    "# Working with Outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in a dataset. They can arise due to variability in the data, measurement errors, or may indicate something interesting (like anomalies). Handling them correctly is crucial for accurate data analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. What Are Outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are observations that lie an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. They can influence statistical analyses, skew means, and affect the performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score method standardizes data points based on the mean and standard deviation. A Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a given value is from the mean. Common practice is to consider values with a Z-score greater than a threshold (typically 3 or -3) as outliers.\n",
