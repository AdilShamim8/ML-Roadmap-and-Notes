    "## Missing Indicators for Missing Data | [Link](https://github.com/AdilShamim8/50-Days-of-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Day%2022%20Missing%20Indicator)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with missing data, simply imputing values (e.g., with the mean, median, or most frequent value) can sometimes hide valuable information about *why* data were missing. A **missing indicator** is an additional binary feature that flags whether the original value was missing (typically, 1 for missing and 0 for observed). This extra feature can help a machine learning model capture any signal associated with the missingness itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Missing Indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preserve Information:** The fact that a value is missing might itself be predictive. For example, if customers with missing income information tend to have a higher default risk, a missing indicator can help your model learn that relationship.\n",
    "- **Combine with Imputation:** When you impute missing values, adding a missing indicator helps differentiate between actual observed values and imputed ones.\n",
    "- **Improve Model Performance:** Some models (especially linear models) can benefit from knowing which values were originally missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Create Missing Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Many libraries offer built-in support for missing indicators. For example, scikit-learn’s `SimpleImputer` has an option called `add_indicator` that appends binary columns indicating missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Scikit-Learn’s SimpleImputer with Missing Indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample DataFrame with missing values\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'Age': [25, np.nan, 35, 40, np.nan, 30],\n",
    "    'Salary': [50000, 60000, np.nan, 80000, 75000, np.nan]\n",
    "})\n",
    "print(\"Original DataFrame:\")\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a SimpleImputer that imputes missing values using the mean and adds missing indicators\n",
    "imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean', add_indicator=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# fit_transform returns a NumPy array with imputed data followed by missing indicators as extra columns.\n",
    "imputed_array = imputer.fit_transform(df)\n",
    "print(\"\\nImputed Array with Missing Indicators:\")\n",
    "print(imputed_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note: The extra columns (missing indicators) are appended at the end in the same order as the features with missing values.\n",
    "# To get the names of the missing indicator columns:\n",
    "missing_indicator = imputer.indicator_.get_feature_names_out(df.columns)\n",
    "print(\"\\nMissing Indicator Column Names:\")\n",
    "print(missing_indicator)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manually Creating Missing Indicator Columns with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manually create missing indicator columns\n",
    "df['Age_missing'] = df['Age'].isnull().astype(int)\n",
    "df['Salary_missing'] = df['Salary'].isnull().astype(int)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Impute missing values (e.g., using the mean)\n",
    "df['Age_imputed'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean())\n",
    "df['Salary_imputed'] = df['Salary'].fillna(df['Salary'].mean())\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nDataFrame with Manual Missing Indicators and Imputed Values:\")\n",
    "print(df[['Age_imputed', 'Age_missing', 'Salary_imputed', 'Salary_missing']])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing indicators** allow your model to learn from the fact that data was missing, which can be predictive in many cases.\n",
    "- You can use built-in tools like scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer` (with `add_indicator=True`) or create them manually using pandas.\n",
    "- Combining imputation with missing indicators is a robust strategy, especially when the reason for missingness may carry important information."
