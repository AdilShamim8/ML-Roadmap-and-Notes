    "# Bagging in Machine Learning | [Link](Bagging/Bagging.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble learning technique used to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning models. It works by creating multiple versions of a predictor by training on bootstrapped samples from the original data, then aggregating their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling:**  \n",
    "  Generate multiple training datasets by randomly sampling (with replacement) from the original dataset. Each bootstrap sample typically contains about 63.2% of unique data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Learners:**  \n",
    "  Train a base model (e.g., decision tree, neural network) on each bootstrap sample independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation:**  \n",
    "  Combine the predictions from all base models:\n",
    "  - For regression: Average the outputs.\n",
    "  - For classification: Use majority voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For **regression**, the aggregated prediction is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "y = (1/N) &sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> f<sub>i</sub>(x)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- <code>N</code> is the number of base models,  \n",
    "- <code>f<sub>i</sub>(x)</code> is the prediction from the <code>i</code><sup>th</sup> model, and  \n",
    "- <code>y</code> is the final aggregated prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **classification**, the final class is determined by the mode (majority vote) of the predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "y = mode { f<sub>1</sub>(x), f<sub>2</sub>(x), ..., f<sub>N</sub>(x) }\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance Reduction:**  \n",
    "  Aggregating predictions from diverse models reduces overall variance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Robustness:**  \n",
    "  Bagging helps to mitigate overfitting and improves model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Training:**  \n",
    "  Since each model is trained independently, the training can be parallelized to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example using the `BaggingClassifier` from scikit-learn with a decision tree as the base estimator on the Wine dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\n",
    "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_wine\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the Wine dataset\n",
    "wine = load_wine()\n",
    "X, y = wine.data, wine.target\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the base classifier (a decision tree in this case)\n",
    "base_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the BaggingClassifier with 10 base estimators\n",
    "bagging_classifier = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=base_classifier, n_estimators=10, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the BaggingClassifier\n",
    "bagging_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test set\n",
    "y_pred = bagging_classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate and print the accuracy\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a simple yet powerful ensemble method that:\n",
    "- **Reduces variance** by averaging predictions from multiple models.\n",
    "- **Improves robustness** against overfitting and noisy data.\n",
    "- **Is highly parallelizable**, making it scalable for large datasets."
