    "# Naive Bayes Classifier Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with a strong (naive) assumption of independence between every pair of features. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is highly effective in many real-world scenarios, particularly in text classification and spam filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of Naive Bayes is Bayes' theorem, which can be expressed in HTML as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "  <b>P</b>(A|B) = (<b>P</b>(B|A) &times; <b>P</b>(A)) / <b>P</b>(B)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- <code>P(A|B)</code> is the **posterior probability**: the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.\n",
    "- <code>P(B|A)</code> is the **likelihood**: the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.\n",
    "- <code>P(A)</code> is the **prior probability**: the initial probability of event A.\n",
    "- <code>P(B)</code> is the **evidence**: the total probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. The Naive Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes is that each feature in a dataset is independent of every other feature, given the class label. This simplifies the computation of the joint likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "  <b>P</b>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>|c) = P(x<sub>1</sub>|c) &times; P(x<sub>2</sub>|c) &times; ... &times; P(x<sub>n</sub>|c)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Decision Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier predicts the class <i>c</i><sub>pred</sub> that maximizes the posterior probability. In HTML, the decision rule can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "  c<sub>pred</sub> = argmax<sub>c &isin; C</sub> (<b>P</b>(c) &times; &prod;<sub>j=1</sub><sup>n</sup> P(x<sub>j</sub>|c))\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- <code>C</code> is the set of all possible classes.\n",
    "- <code>x<sub>j</sub></code> represents the j-th feature.\n",
    "- <code>P(c)</code> is the prior probability for class <code>c</code>.\n",
    "- <code>P(x<sub>j</sub>|c)</code> is the likelihood of feature <code>x<sub>j</sub></code> given class <code>c</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Python Implementation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of implementing a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using the scikit-learn library. This example uses the Iris dataset for demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the Iris dataset\n",
    "iris = load_iris()\n",
    "X, y = iris.data, iris.target\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "gnb = GaussianNB()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model\n",
    "gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test set\n",
    "y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's accuracy\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Loading Data:** The Iris dataset is loaded using `load_iris()`.\n",
    "- **Splitting Data:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Model Training:** A Gaussian Naive Bayes model (`GaussianNB`) is trained on the training data.\n",
    "- **Prediction & Evaluation:** Predictions are made on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated using `accuracy_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a powerful and computationally efficient method for classification tasks. Their strength lies in their simplicity and ability to handle high-dimensional data despite the strong independence assumption. They have been widely used in applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and spam filtering.\n"
