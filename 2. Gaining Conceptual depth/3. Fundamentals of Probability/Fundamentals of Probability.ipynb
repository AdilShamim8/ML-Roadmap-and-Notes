    "# `What is Probability?`\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplest terms, probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is a fundamental concept in statistics and is used to make predictions and informed decisions in a wide range of disciplines, including science, engineering, medicine, economics, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, inclusive:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A probability of 0 means that an event will not happen.\n",
    "*   A probability of 1 means that an event will certainly happen.\n",
    "*   A probability of 0.5 means that an event will happen half the time (or that it is as likely to happen as not to happen)."
